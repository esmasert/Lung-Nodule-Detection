# Lung-Nodule-Detection
I am continuing to doing research within Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering at UCL. In my research, I focused on nodule detection field which tries to find the nodules in lung by using convolutional neural network with the high accuracy and minimized false positive rates by using the CT data.
